I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I’ve said before
All these words, they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You’ll find that out anyway
I find the answers aren’t so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sence

I’m about to break
This room to breathe
This room to breathe
